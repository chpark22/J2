# J2 Worksheet Answer

### 1. Which of the following is an object and which is a basic type?
```
int a; // Basic type 
double b; // Basic type
int c[] = {1, 2, 3}; // Object 
String s = "Hello World"; // Object
```
### 2.A What is a static method in Java?

a method that does not need instance object

### 2.B Why does the main method need to be a static method?

it needs because main has to call without intance object of the class

### 3. What is the output of the following programs?

public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String choice = new String("A");
    if (choice == "A") {
        System.out.println("Correct");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("Wrong");
    }
}
output: Wrong

public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String choice = new String("A");
    if (choice.equals("A")) {
        System.out.println("Correct");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("Wrong");
    }
