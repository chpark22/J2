# J2 Worksheet Answer

### 1. Which of the following is an object and which is a basic type?
```
int a; // Basic type 
double b; // Basic type
int c[] = {1, 2, 3}; // Object 
String s = "Hello World"; // Object
```
### 2.A What is a static method in Java?

a method that does not need instance object

### 2.B Why does the main method need to be a static method?

it needs because main has to call without intance object of the class

### 3. What is the output of the following programs?
```
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String choice = new String("A");
    if (choice == "A") {
        System.out.println("Correct");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("Wrong");
    }
}
```
output: Wrong
```
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String choice = new String("A");
    if (choice.equals("A")) {
        System.out.println("Correct");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("Wrong");
    }
}
```
output: Correct


### 4. Does the below program change the season? Why, or why not?
```
static void change_season(String str) {
    str = "Spring";
}

public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String season = "Winter";
    change_season(season);
    System.out.println("The current season is: " + season);
}
```
It changed since change_season has been commanded with Spring after season equals to Winter.

### 5. What is the output of the main method below? Please explain.
```
public class Point {
    double x = 0;
    double y = 0;

    public Point(double x, double y) {
        x = x;
        y = y;
    }
}
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    Point point = new Point(1, 2);
    System.out.println("X: " + point.x + " Y: " + point.y);
}
```
Output is X: 0.0, Y: 0.0 Since x = x and y = y assigns the parameter to itself without changing instance variable.

### 6. What principle of OOP does the private declaration for variable and functions achieve? Explain.
Encapsulation is the OOP which declares variable and finctions as private. It hides the internal implementation function of a class, and only the variable can be changed through access methods.
### 7. In the Point class below, how does Java choose between the two constructors.
```
public class Point {

   private double x, y; 
   
   public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
   }

   public Point(Point other) {
       this.x = other.getX();
       this.y = other.getY();
   }

}
```
Java will choose which constructors is calling first.
### 8. For the below questions, when the class Point is referenced, we are talking about the below class, which you can assume is fully implemented and working as described:
```
public class Point {
   private double x,y; //the x,y fields
   public Point(double x,double y); //construct a point from an x,y
   public Point(Point other); //construct a point from another point
   public double getX(); //return the x component
   public double getY(); //return the y component
   public double setXY(double x, double y); //sets the x and y fields
   public String toString(); //return the string representation
   private double sum_x_y(); // Returns the sum of X and Y
}
```
Say we want to make a class that extends Point with a method that can reflect a point across the X and Y axis:
```
public class CustomPoint extends Point {
    public void reflect(); // Reflects point
}
```
Which of the following implementations achieves this?
```
 // Option 1
    public void reflect() {
        x = -x;
        y = -y;
    }

    // Option 2
    public void reflect() {
        this.x = -this.x;
        this.y = -this.y;
    }

    // Option 3
    public void reflect() {
        this = Point(-x,-y);
    }
    
    // Option 4
    public void reflect() {
        double x = -this.getX();
        double y =-this.getY();
        this.setXY(x,y);
    }
    
    // Option 5
    public void reflect() {
        x = -this.getX();
        y = -this.getY();
    }
```
Explain why.
- Only Option 4 is able to reflect the point, otherwise none of them cannot be read to the CustomPoint
### 9. If we add this constructor to CustomPoint:

    public CustomPoint() {
        setXY(10, 10); // Line 1
        super(0, 0); // Line 2
    }
â€¦and then run this program, what is the output?


### 10. What if we switch line 1 and 2 in the previous question?

### 11. If we want to override sum_x_y in our custom point, but first reflect the point before returning the sum, which of the following implementations are valid? (Note: assume that reflect has a valid implementation)

### 12. What is the point of the protected modifier? Why do we have it and how does it work in terms of inheritance?

### 13. 

### 14. Using the Racecar and FormulaOne classes above, if we had a main method in a different class than either of those, does the code work at mark A or mark B or neither? Explain.
